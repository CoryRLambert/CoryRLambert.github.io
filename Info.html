  <h1>Newton's Laws of Motion:</h1>
	  
		<p>Newton's first law of motion is often stated as
		An object at rest stays at rest and an object in 
		motion stays in motion with the same speed and in 
		the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

		<p>Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:</p>

		<p>The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly 
		proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction 
		as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
		This verbal statement can be expressed in equation form as follows:</p>

		<h4>a = F / m</h4>

		
		<p>The above equation is often rearranged to a more familiar form as shown below. The net force is equated to the 
		product of the mass times the acceleration.</p>

		<h4>F = m • a</h4>

		<p>Formally stated, Newton's third law is:</p>

		<p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
		The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair 
		of forces acting on the two interacting objects. 
		The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the 
		force on the second object. 
		The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the 
		direction of the force on the second object.</p> 
		<p>Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.</p>


		<h3>The First Law of Motion</h3>
		
		<p>An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. 
		An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an 
		unbalanced force.</p>

		<p>This law is often called  "the law of inertia".</p>

		<h3>The Second Law of Motion</h3>
		
		<p>Acceleration is produced when a force acts on a mass. The greater the mass (of the object being accelerated) 
		the greater the amount of force needed (to accelerate the object).</p>

		<p>What does this mean?</p>
		<p>Everyone unconsiously knows the Second Law. Everyone knows that heavier objects require more force to move the 
		same distance as lighter objects.</p>

		<p>However, the Second Law gives us an exact relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It can be 
		expressed as a mathematical equation: </p>
		<p>or </p>
		<p>FORCE = MASS times ACCELERATION</p>

		<h3>The Third Law of Motion</h3>
		
		<p>For every action there is an equal and opposite re-action.</p>
		<p>What does this mean? </p>

		<p>This means that for every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, 
		but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another 
		object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard. </p>

  <h1>The Laws of Thermodynamics</h1>
		<h3>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

		<p>The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created 
		nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another. For example, turning on a light would 
		seem to produce energy; however, it is electrical energy that is converted.</p>

		<p>A way of expressing the first law of thermodynamics is that any change in the internal energy (∆E) of a system is given by 
		the sum of the heat (q) that flows across its boundaries and the work (w) done on the system by the surroundings:</p>

		<h4>ΔE=q+w</h4>

		<p>This law says that there are two kinds of processes, heat and work, that can lead to a change in the internal energy of a 
		system. Since both heat and work can be measured and quantified, this is the same as saying that any change in the energy 
		of a system must result in a corresponding change in the energy of the surroundings outside the system. In other words, 
		energy cannot be created or destroyed. If heat flows into a system or the surroundings do work on it, the internal energy 
		increases and the sign of q and w are positive. Conversely, heat flow out of the system or work done by the system (on the
		surroundings) will be at the expense of the internal energy, and q and w will therefore be negative.</p>

		<h3>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

		<p>The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of any isolated system always increases. Isolated systems 
		spontaneously evolve towards thermal equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy of the system. More simply put: the 
		entropy of the universe (the ultimate isolated system) only increases and never decreases.</p>

		<p>A simple way to think of the second law of thermodynamics is that a room, if not cleaned and tidied, will invariably 
		become more messy and disorderly with time - regardless of how careful one is to keep it clean. When the room is cleaned, 
		its entropy decreases, but the effort to clean it has resulted in an increase in entropy outside the room that exceeds the 
		entropy lost.</p>
	
		<h3>The Third Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

		<p>The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature 
		approaches absolute zero. The entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically zero, and in all cases is determined 
		only by the number of different ground states it has. Specifically, the entropy of a pure crystalline substance (perfect 
		order) at absolute zero temperature is zero. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state with 
		minimum energy.</p>

  <h1>IPV4 Classes</h1>
<p>Ths is an Internet Protocol (IPv4) Subnet Chart. You can use this to quickly look up how your might need to subnet your network. At the bottom there is 
a quick how-to on calculating subnets.</p>


<p>Class address ranges:
<UL>
<LI>Class A = 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0</LI>

<LI>Class B = 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0</LI>
<LI>Class C = 192.0.1.0 to 223.255.255.0</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<p>Reserved address ranges for private (non-routed) use : 
<UL>
<LI>10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255</LI>
<LI>172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255</LI>
<LI>192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255</LI>

</UL>
</p>

<p>Other reserved addresses:
<UL>
<LI>127.0.0.0 is reserved for loopback and IPC on the local host</LI>
<LI>224.0.0.0 -> 239.255.255.255 is reserved for multicast addresses</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<p>Chart notes:
<UL>
<LI>Number of Subnets - Refers to the number of effective subnets,
since the use of subnet numbers of all 0s or all 1s is highly frowned upon and
RFC non-compliant.</LI>
<LI>Number of Hosts - Refers to the number of effective hosts, excluding the
network and broadcast address.</LI>

	<h1>[Understanding Decimal - Base 10]</h1>
</b><br><br>

The first thing you must know is that the common number system used world wide is the <b>decimal system</b> (otherwise known as <b>base 10</b>). What makes the decimal 
system a base 10 system is that it is <i><b>based on grouping numbers by 10's</b></i>. It is believed that the system evolved because we have ten fingers and ten  toes 
which over the years we have used for counting. I use mine all the time (grin).  We name the ten digits:  zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and 
nine.<br><br>

The decimal system has a <b>1</b>'s place, a <b>10</b>'s place, a <b>100</b>'s place, a <b>1000</b>'s place and so on. We say the number places are grouped  by 10's 
because
<i><b>multiplying each number place by 10 gives you the next number place</b></i>. So:  1x10=10 (the 10's place), 10x10=100 (the 100's place), 
100x10=1000 (the 1000's place) etc.<br><br>

Let's look at the decimal number <b>103</b> by place.<br><br>

<b>103</b> <- <i>read from right to left</i><br><br>

We have a <b>3</b> in the <b>1's place</b><br>

We have a <b>0</b>in the <b>10's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>100's place</b><br><br>

Thus: <b>100+0+3=103</b><br><br>

By now you probably feel like you have attended Kindergarten for the second time in your life? Sorry about that but it is very important that you
understand the concept of what a number system is, and what it is based on before we look at binary.

<h1>[Understanding Binary - Base 2]</h1>
<br><br>

Binary is a <i>base 2</i> system, and thus groups numbers by 2's and not by 10's like the decimal system.  We name the two digits:  zero and one. The binary system has a 
<b>1</b>'s place, a <b>2</b>'s place, a <b>4</b>'s place, an <b>8</b>'s place, a <b>16</b>'s place and so on. We say the number places are grouped  by 2's because 
<i><b>multiplying each number place by 2 gives you the next number place</b></i>. So:  1x2=2 (the 2's place), 2x2=4 (the 4's place), 4x2=8 (the 8's 
place), 8x2=16 (the 16's place) etc. 


<br><br>

Let's look at the decimal number Let's look at the decimal number <b>103</b> in <i>binary format</i>:<br><br> 

<b>01100111</b> <- <i>read from right to left</i><br><br>

We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>1's place</b><br>

We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>2's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>4's place</b><br>
We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>8's place</b><br>

We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>16's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>32's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>64's place</b><br>

We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>128's place</b><br><br>

Thus: <b>0+64+32+0+0+4+2+1=103</b><br><br>

<h1>[Understanding a SubnetMask]</h1>

Now that you understand what binary is, let's have a look at our two subnet masks from the beginning of my post:<br><br>

<b>
192.168.1.0 / 255.255.255.0<br>
192.168.1.0/24</b><br><br>

The concept of a subnet mask is simple.  You have a network and you have hosts on the network (anything with an IP address is a host). <i><b>The subnet mask determines 
what portion of the TCP/IP address represents your network and what portion can be used for your hosts</b></i>. Because I am a simple person, I think of it like this; The 
network number represents the street I live on, and the host portion is used for the numbers on all the houses on my street. <br><br>

A subnet mask of <b>255.255.255.0</b> means that the first <i>three</i> octets of the address will be used for the network, and thus our network number is 
<b>192.168.1</b>. This means we can have <b>254</b> computers on this network, because the fourth octet is not being used by the network portion of the address. We know 
this because of the <b>0 </b>in the subnet mask (255.255.255.<b>0</b>). <br><br> 

We call each of the number sections an <i><b>octet</b></i> because we think of them in binary, and there are eight possible bits in each section. Eight bits is an octet.  
<b>11111111</b> in binary is <b>255</b> in decimal (did you do the conversions?). So our decimal subnet mask 255.255.255.0 displayed in binary is 
going to be:<br><br>


11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

<br><br>

If you count all the ones, you will find that there are <b>24</b> of them. Now look at the subnet mask examples again.<br><br>

<b>
192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0<br>
192.168.1.0/24</b><br><br>

Do you see why <i>both subnet masks are the same</i>?  The number <b>24</b> is the number of <b><i>bits</i></b> used in the network portion of the address, and is 
short-hand for writing the address/subnet mask combination. It becomes important to understand this when you start dividing your network into multiple sub networks.

<h1>[Understanding Subnetting]</h1>
Before reading this section, you should have a <i>good understanding</i> of what a subnet mask is and how binary bits represent the subnet mask.<br><br>

Simply put, subnetting is <i>dividing your network into <b>multiple sub networks</b></i>. To go back to my silly example about houses and streets, subnetting gives you 
multiple streets in your neighborhood.<br><br>

There are <i>two methods</i> for dividing your network into multiple sub networks; One is to simply change your network numbers keeping the same subnet mask. The other is 
to subnet your network into smaller sub networks.<br><br>

Keeping the same mask:<br>
Your network could be divided into two or more networks by changing the network portion of the address such as <i>192.168.1</i> and <i>192.168.2</i> and keeping the same 
subnet mask.<br><br>

<i>Example:</i><br>
<b>192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0</b><br>
<b>192.168.2.0/255.255.255.0</b><br><br>

Doing this would give you <b>two separate networks</b> with <b>254 hosts per network</b>. This is a very common method of dealing with multiple networks. However, back in 
the good old days you had to pay for every IP address you used, and if you had 25 computers on your network you probably would not want to pay for 254 addresses! The 
answer to the problem is...subnetting.<br><br>

Subnetting a network:<br>
<b><i>Subnetting is when you use bits from the host portion of your address as part of your network number</i></b>. This let's you subdivide your network at the cost of 
host addresses, which is great if you're paying for every host IP address. It will save you money because you pay for fewer TCP/IP addresses. Confused? Here is where 
understanding binary is important.<br><br>

Lets look at a new subnet mask:<br>

<b>255.255.255.224</b><br><br>

As you can see in the fourth octet, some of the host portion of this subnet mask is now being used for part of the network address. Which means 
we are <i><b>now using some of the binary bits in the fourth octet for our network numbers</b></i>, and that gives us fewer hosts than our old mask (which gave us 254), 
but gives us more networks (which is why we call it subnetting). <br><br>

How can we tell how many networks and hosts per network this new subnet mask will give us? Well... we shall have to use some of our newly acquired binary skills.<br><br>

The <i>first task</i> is to find out <b><i>how many bits in the fourth octet are being used</i></b>?  The decimal number is 224, what is the decimal number 224 as 
represented in binary?<br><br>

The decimal number <b>224</b> in binary is: <br>
<b>11100000</b><br><br>

We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>1's place</b><br>
We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>2's place</b><br>

We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>4's place</b><br>
We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>8's place</b><br>
We have a <b>0</b> in the <b>16's place</b><br>

We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>32's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>64's place</b><br>
We have a <b>1</b> in the <b>128's place</b><br><br>

Thus: 128+64+32+0+0+0+0+0=<b>224</b>
<br><br>

So our complete subnet mask in binary is:<br>

1111111.11111111.11111111.<b>11100000</b><br><br>

We now know that three bits from the fourth octet are used. How can we tell how many sub networks we're going to have?
This requires some math - sorry.  The formula is: <b>2<sup>n</sup>-2</b>, where <b><i>n</i></b> is the 
<i>number of bits being used from the host portion</i> of our subnet mask. <br><br>

<b>Important Note:</b>We <I>subtract 2 networks (the first and last subnets) from the total</I> unless we have equipment that supports
IP Subnet-Zero in which case we use the formula <B>2<SUP>n</SUP></B> - please see the addendum at the end of this
lesson for more details.<BR><BR>

The formula for <i><b>three bits</b></i> is:<br>
<b>2<sup>3</sup>-2</b>=6<br><br>

In simpler terms:<br>
<b>(2x2x2)-2</b>=6<br><br>

So our network is <b>sub divided into 6 networks</b>. Next, we want to know what the network numbers are, and how many hosts we can have on each of the 6 networks?<br><br>

What is the first subnet?  Let's have a look at the bits in our <i>fourth octet</i> again. The bit that gives us the answer is the <i>(1) closest to the first zero</i>, 
and in this case it is the 3rd bit from the left.<br><br>

11<b>1</b>00000<br><br>


The 3rd bit will <i>start our first network</i>, and the 3rd bit is in the <b><i>32</i></b>'s place (remember binary).  Start adding the value 32 to itself six times to 
get the six network numbers.<br><br>
 
<b>Note:</b>  A quicker way to find our starting network number is to <i>subtract our
mask from 256</i>.<br>

<b>256-224</b>=32<br><br>

Here are our network numbers:<br><br>

32<br>
64<br>
96<br>
128<br>
160<br>

192
<br><br>
A better way to display this is:<br><br>


192.168.1.<b>32</b><br>
192.168.1.<b>64</b><br>
192.168.1.<b>96</b><br>

192.168.1.<b>128</b><br>

192.168.1.<b>160</b><br>
192.168.1.<b>192</b><br>
<br>

The host addresses will <i>fall between the network numbers</i>, so we will have <b>30</b>

hosts per network. You're probably wondering why it's <i><b>not</b></i> 31?   The answer is that the last address of each subnet is used as the <i>broadcast address</i> 
for that subnet. <br><br>

Example:<br>
<b>Subnet:</b>192.168.1.32 / 255.255.255.224<br> 

<b>Address Range:</b> 192.168.1.33 through 192.168.1.62  (30 hosts)<br>

<b>Subnet Broadcast Address:</b>192.168.1.63<br><br>
