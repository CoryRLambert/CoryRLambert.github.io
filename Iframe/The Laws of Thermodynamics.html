<h2>The Laws of Thermodynamics</h2>
<h3>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

<p>The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created 
nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another. For example, turning on a light would 
seem to produce energy; however, it is electrical energy that is converted.</p>

<p>A way of expressing the first law of thermodynamics is that any change in the internal energy (∆E) of a system is given by 
the sum of the heat (q) that flows across its boundaries and the work (w) done on the system by the surroundings:</p>

<h4>ΔE=q+w</h4>

<p>This law says that there are two kinds of processes, heat and work, that can lead to a change in the internal energy of a 
system. Since both heat and work can be measured and quantified, this is the same as saying that any change in the energy 
of a system must result in a corresponding change in the energy of the surroundings outside the system. In other words, 
energy cannot be created or destroyed. If heat flows into a system or the surroundings do work on it, the internal energy 
increases and the sign of q and w are positive. Conversely, heat flow out of the system or work done by the system (on the
surroundings) will be at the expense of the internal energy, and q and w will therefore be negative.</p>

<h3>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

<p>The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of any isolated system always increases. Isolated systems 
spontaneously evolve towards thermal equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy of the system. More simply put: the 
entropy of the universe (the ultimate isolated system) only increases and never decreases.</p>

<p>A simple way to think of the second law of thermodynamics is that a room, if not cleaned and tidied, will invariably 
become more messy and disorderly with time - regardless of how careful one is to keep it clean. When the room is cleaned, 
its entropy decreases, but the effort to clean it has resulted in an increase in entropy outside the room that exceeds the 
entropy lost.</p>

<h3>The Third Law of Thermodynamics</h3>

<p>The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature 
approaches absolute zero. The entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically zero, and in all cases is determined 
only by the number of different ground states it has. Specifically, the entropy of a pure crystalline substance (perfect 
order) at absolute zero temperature is zero. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state with 
minimum energy.</p>
